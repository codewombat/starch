Installation
------------
- Starch is best used with the core two-column layout and default Post content type.
- Install this theme using the official [Backdrop instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/themes).

Recommended configuration
-------------------------
- Visit the configuration page under **Appearance > Themes** to enable Starch.
- Configure its settings form to select a featured image field.
- Edit your default layout, ensuring it is the core two-column layout.
- Configure the _Header_ block to use the _Primary navigation_ menu.
- Configure the _Breadcrumb_ block to add a visibility condition excluding it from node/* paths.
- Add the _Search form_, _User login_, and other blocks to the sidebar as desired.
- Install the [Social Icons](https://github.com/codewombat/social_icons) module and place it in the _Header_ region above the _Header block_.

This theme is really suited to visual blogging, where each blog has at least a large, beautiful header image. The image will be displayed above the node title in the default front page teaser list and above the page title on the full page node display.

Note that it currently only supports the default _Post_ content type.
